Matplotlib is a Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is widely used for plotting graphs and charts, making it an essential tool for data visualization in data science,
 machine learning, and scientific computing.

Main Features of Matplotlib:
    Line Plots: Used to visualize data trends over continuous domains, like time or measurements.
    Scatter Plots: Useful to visualize relationships between two variables and the spread of data.
    Bar Charts: Useful to compare quantities across different categories.
    Histograms: Used to visualize the distribution of a dataset.
    Pie Charts: Useful to show proportions of a whole.
    Subplots: Allows you to create multiple plots in a single figure, enabling easier comparisons.
