Simple linear regression

    Preprocess the data (clean, scale, split).
    Fit the model using OLS.
    Check for key assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, etc.).
    Diagnose model issues (e.g., Cook’s Distance, leverage points).
    Evaluate the model (R², MSE, RMSE).
    Plot the residuals to check homoscedasticity.
    Check for normality of residuals (Q-Q Plot).
    Interpret the model coefficients.
    Improve the model (if needed).
    Deploy the model for predictions.

Multiple linear regression
    Preprocess the data (clean, scale, encode, split).
    Fit the model using OLS.
    Check for key assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, etc.).
    Check for multicollinearity using VIF.
    Diagnose model issues (Cook’s Distance, leverage points).
    Evaluate the model (R², MSE, RMSE).
    Plot the residuals to check homoscedasticity.
    Check for normality of residuals (Q-Q Plot).
    Interpret the model coefficients.
    Improve the model (if needed).
    Deploy the model for predictions.
