Wald’s Test and LR Test are used for testing the significance of predictors and comparing models.
Pseudo R-squared, Deviance, and AIC/BIC help assess model fit.
Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC are for classification performance evaluation.
Cook’s Distance and Leverage help detect influential points that could affect model performance.
Shapiro-Wilk, Breusch-Pagan, and Durbin-Watson help assess residuals and model assumptions.
