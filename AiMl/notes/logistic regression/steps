Preprocess the data:

Clean the data (handle missing values, remove duplicates, etc.).

    Scale numerical features if needed.

    Encode categorical features:
    encoded_df = pd.get_dummies(df[X_features], columns=categorical_features, drop_first=True)

Split the dataset:
    X = sm.add_constant(encoded_df)
    Y = df[what to predict]

Fit the model using OLS:

    Train a logistic regression model using statsmodels:
    logit_model = sm.Logit(Y_train, X_train)
    result = logit_model.fit()

Check key assumptions:

    Linearity of independent variables with the log-odds.
    No perfect multicollinearity.
    Homoscedasticity.
    Check for multicollinearity:
    Use Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity issues.
    vif_data["VIF"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X_train.values, i) for i in range(X_train.shape[1])]

Diagnose model issues:

Examine Cookâ€™s Distance for influential points.

Check leverage points to identify outliers.

Evaluate the model:

Accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.

Sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall.

Plot residuals:

Residual plot to check for homoscedasticity.

Q-Q plot to assess normality of residuals.

Interpret model coefficients:

Analyze odds ratios for interpretability.

Understand the impact of each feature on the prediction.

Improve the model if needed:

Feature engineering.

Try interaction terms or polynomial features.

Tune hyperparameters.

Deploy the model:

Save the model for future predictions.

Use trained model to make predictions on new data.
