Load the Dataset:

Import the dataset (e.g., from a CSV file, database, etc.).
You can use pandas for loading and inspecting data.
Handle Missing Values:

Fill or remove any missing data. You can use dropna() to remove rows with missing values or fillna() to fill them with the mean, median, or mode.
Feature Selection:

Identify and select relevant features (independent variables) for training.
Exclude non-informative or redundant features.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

If the dataset contains categorical variables, convert them into numerical values using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies()) or label encoding.
Split the Dataset:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, typically using train_test_split() from sklearn.model_selection.
Normalization/Scaling:

Optionally, normalize or scale the data, especially if the features have different scales. Use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.
Train the Decision Tree Model:

Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree.
Set key parameters like criterion, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf.
Fit the model using the training dataset.
Evaluate the Model:

After training, use the test data to evaluate the model's performance. You can calculate accuracy, precision, recall, or use confusion matrices.
