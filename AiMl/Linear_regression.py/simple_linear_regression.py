No pattern(should be)
    scattered around the horizontal zero line, with no clear pattern, it indicates that your model is doing well!
    Ideal Scenario: No pattern and a uniform spread.

    There is no systematic bias (no tendency for the residuals to be larger for certain predictions).
    The model is appropriately capturing the relationship between marks and salary.
    The residuals are normally distributed (a prerequisite for OLS regression).

Funnel Shape or Spread Increasing/Decreasing
    residuals get larger as the fitted values increase or decrease), it indicates heteroscedasticity:

    This means that the variance of the residuals is not constant across the range of fitted values.
    In simpler terms, the model`s errors are more variable at certain points 

    What to do: If you see this, it may suggest the need for a transformation of the dependent variable (like log-transformation) 
        or you may need to reconsider the model choice (maybe nonlinear regression or robust regression).

Curved or Non-Linear Pattern
     it suggests that the model is missing a nonlinear relationship between the independent variable (marks) and the dependent variable (salary).

     What to do: If you see a curved pattern, it might be worth considering:
        Polynomial regression (adding higher-order terms like marksÂ²).
        Nonlinear regression models.

Clusters or Outliers:
     If you see certain points far away from the general cluster (outliers), this indicates outliers or high-leverage points in the data.

     What to do: Investigate outliers to see if they are genuine or errors in the data. If they are influential points, 
        you might want to consider removing them or using a more robust regression method.
